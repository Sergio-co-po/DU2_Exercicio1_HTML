    <h1>Types of monkeys</h1>
    <h2>Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur</h2>
    <p>Lac Alaotra bamboo lemurs are prosimians. You can recognise them by their pointed nose with a wet tip. They have brown, woolly fur and scent glands on their forearms, around their armpits and around their anus. With these glands they mark the area to make it clear for other animals that it’s their territory.</p>

    <h2>Barbary macaque</h2>
    <p>Barbary macaques have thick, brown-yellow fur, which protects them against rain and cold. Males and females look alike, although males are often slightly larger. A funny fact is that barbary macaques don’t have a visible tail. They only have a small stump that is hidden by their fur. Barbary macaques have cheek pouches. They use them to save food to eat later at a quiet moment. Their cheek pouches can hold as much food as their stomachs!</p>
